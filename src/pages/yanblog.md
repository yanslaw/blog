This jumpstart is intended to be _just enough_ to be a functional site/blog using 11ty, and also to introduce essential 11ty features.

[**Review the "Quick Start"**](/#quickstart) on the home page for how to get this starter up and running for your project.

### Colophon

Hi, I'm Stephanie Eckles - @5t3ph on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/5t3ph), [润涛阎定律](https://yanruntao.netlify.app), [CodePen](https://codepen.com/5t3ph), and [DEV](https://dev.to/5t3ph). You may know me as the author of [ModernCSS.dev](https://moderncss.dev) or the creator of [StyleStage.dev](https://stylestage.dev). I can also be found on [egghead as an instructor](https://egghead.io/instructors/stephanie-eckles?af=2s65ms).

I spent a decade creating WordPress themes and plugins then flipped to product development + leading development of a multi-platform enterprise design system. My intro to JAMstack was with Gatsby, but 11ty fills a special place that is so needed for truly static sites. I'm in love, and I think you will be, too.
